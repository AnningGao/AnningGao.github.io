We conduct a search for the strong OVI absorptions related with damped Lyman-$$\alpha$$ systems from DESI EDR high S/N, $z\sim 2.5$ quasar spectra.

1. We normalize the quasar continuum with a unsupervised machine learning method ([Sun et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..269....4S/abstract)) and achieve a great result (**Figure 1**). ![OVI1](/images/OVI1.png).
2. We visually inspect ~2500 normalized spectra and find ~30 OVI systems that are correlated with DLA systems (**Figure 2**). ![OVI2](/images/OVI2.png)
3. We jointly fit the Voigt profile with other metal absorbers (**Figure 3**). ![OVI3](/images/OVI3.png) ![OVI4](/images/OVI4.png)
4. We estimate the contamination from Ly$$\alpha$$ forest from mock spectra (**Figure 4**) ![OVI5](/images/OVI5.png)
5. We conduct cloudy simulations to probe the ionization state of absorbers (no figure â˜¹ )
