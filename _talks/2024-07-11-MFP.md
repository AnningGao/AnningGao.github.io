Presentation of my work at DESI 2024 Summer Meeting.

## Contents

- Introduction for the significance of mean free path measurements.
- Brief introduction for our method: quasar spectrum stacking.
- Our results:
  1. Systematically shallower evolution of the mean free path at z<5
  2. Confirmation of the change of evolution speed at z~5 and the interpretation as the end of reionization
- Validation of our results: previous work neglected the evolution of Lyman series opacity.
