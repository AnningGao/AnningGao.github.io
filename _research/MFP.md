We constructed a sample of ~12,600 quasars and perform the mean free path measurements.

**Main findings:**

- Our measured mean free path is systematically lower than the previous results **(Figure 1)**, especially at $$z\lesssim 4$$. We believe that it is mainly due to the neglection of Lyman series opacity evolution of the previous work, which made their results biased toward higher values. ![MFP1](/images/MFP1.png)
- Incorporating all the measurements from the literaure, we believe the overall evolution of mean free path can be empirically well-described by a broken power law, with the broken redshift $$z_0\sim 5$$ **(Figure 2)**, which may have a tight relation with the ending of reionization. ![MFP2](/images/MFP2.jpg)
- Our results show the discrepancy with the other empirical IGM absorber models, which indicates the neccessity of improving the current models **(Figure 3)**. ![MFP3](/images/MFP3.png)
