This is the extension of course project of "Observation Astronomy" taught by Prof. Sharon Xuesong Wang in Spring 2022. We took the spectrum of transient AT2022jrp and measured the equivalent width (EW) of H$$\alpha$$ line. Combining the V band magnitude from AAVSO, we believe there is probably a correlation in the time variation between the EW and V magnitude. **Figure 1** shows the two curves, where the EW curve is shifted along the time axis to better illustrate the correlation. As this is a periodic transient, the best matching between the EW and V magnitude has a time delay for ~0.2 period. This is a weird phenomenon that seems not have been observed before ðŸ¤”, but we do not know how to interprete it.
